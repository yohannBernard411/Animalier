Why this site?

  I wanted to discover my other passion which is wildlife photography. This passion being visual and aesthetic, I created a somewhat special menu. Moreover, not wanting this site to remain a simple photo library, I added the location on google map to add more interactivity.

This repository contains:

1. [The front end](https://github.com/yohannBernard411/animalier/tree/main/src/main/resources/static) who is build in angular with the command line "ng build --configuration production" on Visual Studio Code.
2. [The back end](https://github.com/yohannBernard411/animalier/tree/main/src/main/java/com/generique/essai) who is create with Java on Eclipse IDE.

This Back-end cotains:

1. [Controllers](https://github.com/yohannBernard411/animalier/tree/main/src/main/java/com/generique/essai/controllers).
2. [Models](https://github.com/yohannBernard411/animalier/tree/main/src/main/java/com/generique/essai/models).

## Components

Most of the front end components come from [Material Angular](https://material.angular.io/).
The Google map display uses the [Angular Google Maps](https://angular-maps.com/) API. This display is simplified by the GPS coordinates of each photo. The videos are played by the [youtube-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/youtube-player) component.

## Responsive

The interactive menu in landscape mode does not allow display on smartphones, which is why I have chosen to offer this site only on desktop. I looked for the best solution for a correct display in the maximum configuration (screen, resolution, proportion, ...).

## Avis

This site is bound to evolve, that's why I added a contact section, where you can give me your opinion, suggest changes, tell me what could be added. Do not hesitate to post a comment, I will answer it with great pleasure.

## Application

You can test my Animalier application [here](https://www.wildlifeclubphoto.fr).
